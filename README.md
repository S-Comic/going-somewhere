# Going somewhere?

## What is it?

This is a little proof of concept website which was originally going to be coded during the 2018 Uhack Youth Hackathon. The hackathon was cancelled, so I decided to code it anyway!

Going somewhere? is a proof of concept driving education website specifically for the island of Jersey. It's technially still a work of progress. It was coded in the shortest amount of time possible, so please excuse any bugs, inefficient code and general code messiness.
